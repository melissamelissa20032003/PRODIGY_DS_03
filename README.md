Building this projet was the first real implimentation of a course I took in coursera for building a Decision Tree Model ,where I learn how to creat classification and regression decision using two importante algorithms CART and C4.5.

In this projet here is the steps I have gone through :
- I considered that I may need to discretize continuous variables before using them with decision tree algorithms.
- I was ware that decision trees are prone to overfitting, so I Performed pre-pruning by tuning various decision tree hyperparameters, like the maximum depth of the tree, to help reduce overfitting.
- Evaluate the model using the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
